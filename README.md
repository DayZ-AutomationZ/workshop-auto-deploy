# Workshop Auto-Deploy — Website

This repository contains the static website for the AutomationZ **Workshop Auto-Deploy** tool.

The site explains what the tool does, why it exists, and how it fits into an automated DayZ server workflow.
It includes a short overview, screenshots, and links to the actual tool repositories.

No code lives here — this repo is only for documentation and presentation.

The website is hosted via GitHub Pages and intended as a simple, permanent reference for server admins.
